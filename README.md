<p align="center">A repository to compose tweets together using <a href="https://github.com/gr2m/twitter-together">twitter-together</a>.</p>

## How to contribute a tweet

Follow [these instructions](./tweets) for a detailed guide, but the short version is: create a `.tweet` file in `/tweets` and open a pull request. We'll review it, and once it's merged, the [@ProbotTheRobot](https://twitter.com/ProbotTheRobot) Twitter account will tweet it out!

## What to Tweet

We encourage anyone to craft and form a tweet, by opening a PR in the tweets folder. Possible topics include:

- Interesting usage/use-cases of Probot
- Tutorials/projects about GitHub workflow automation
- News about Probot and related projects
- Other items relevant to the Probot community

If you build an app with Probot, we are happy to share the word! The app should either be open source or should mention that it’s built with Probot, in the marketplace/app description as well as the website if one exists.

## Accepting a tweet

One acceptance by a maintainer is enough for a merge.
